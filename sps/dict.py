    #• SPS dictionaries; modularizing the dictionaries means implementing functions that operate on dictionary to determine whether it contains an entry for a particular name, to retrieve the value associated with a particular name, and to enter a new (name, value) pair.

    #• the dictionary stack: as with the operand stack, implement functions to push and pop values on the dictionary stack, check whether it is empty, etc.
