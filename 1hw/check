the population of burmese pythons presently established in
the park is the result of accidental and/or intentional releases by
pet owners. these introductions can have devastating consequences to
our ecosystem. burmese pythons have been found to feed on a wide
variety of mammals and birds in the everglades-even the occasional
alligator! by preying on native wildlife, and competing with other
native predators, pythons are seriously impacting the natural order
of south florida's ecological communities. the continued
proliferation of burmese pythons-and the continued introduction of
new foreign species-can further threaten many of the endangered
plants and animals we're working diligently
to protect. (www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/burmesepythonsintro.htm)
