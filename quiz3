Dynamic vs Static Scoping

    ML uses static scoping.

    1) Given ML code (static scoping): 
        give output value and reasoning 
        ML uses static scoping, so the function uses y=4 because that was the state of the environment when function Foo was defined.
    
    2) Now suppose ML is using dynamic scoping rules (it doesn't):
        Give return value and reasoning 
        Because dynamic scoping is being used, ... is using becuase it is the most recent activation record on the stack


Pass-by-value vs Pass-by-reference

    Python uses pass-by-value, but arrays use pointer. Passing an array would behave like pass by reference!

    3) Value:
        Passes a copy, so changes DON NOT affect the variable passed to the function.

    4) Reference:
        Passes a pointer, so changes DO affect the variable passed to the function.
        

Abstract Data Type

    Look at ML Complex Numbers example
    Note the difference between the use of '+' and 'add'
