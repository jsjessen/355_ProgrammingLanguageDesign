# This submission is based on the template interpreter:
# A simple postscript interpreter. It provides only minimal error
# checking.
# CptS 355 students have permission to use this code as the basis
# for their SSPS interpreter (not for the SPS interpreter!)
# PROVIDED that these header comments are left in the file,
# and that you replace the "Put your name" line above
# with your own name and the date (month and year is sufficient)

# Slightly improved and updated for Python3 9 Nov 2014

# Design decisions:
# the stack is implemented as a python list using s.pop and s.append for pop and push
# the dictStack is implemented as python list with the "warm" end at 0
# postscript names represented as python strings and do not include the leading /
# code arrays are represented as lists containing tokens, not including the surround braces
# postscript true and false are represented as python True and False
# postscript numbers are represented as python float values

# Define a separate function for each arithmetic and boolean
# primitive function

# Arithmetic ops: each take two numbers and return a number
